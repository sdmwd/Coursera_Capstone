    "According to Insee www.insee.fr, there are more than 45,000 restaurants in Paris and about 2.2 million people. London has approximately 16,000 restaurants for 9 million people. That is why opening a new restaurant in Paris can be an extremely challenging task compared to doing so in London. Choosing a restaurant type and a good spot, an entrepreneur or an investor usually relies on common sense and domain knowledge. Needless to say that too often an inconsiderate decision leads to a poor income and inevitable bankruptcy."
